# My Prototype 

##Background
While working on my Masters of Engineering Science, I was required to create prototypes of my proposed graphical authentication schemes. 
In the beginning, I used Streamlit, a framework that is usually used for Data Science to create this application. I chose this as I had been familiar with Streamlit from working with it before on my Final Year Project of my Degree in Computer Engineering.
Working with the limitations, I managed to get my prototype up and running.

## How It Works
